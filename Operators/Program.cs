/*
    Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
    In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
 */


//Arithmetic Operators
/*
     +	Addition	Adds together two values	
     -	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another
     *	Multiplication	Multiplies two values
     /	Division	Divides one value by another
     %	Modulus	Returns the division remainder
     ++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1
     --	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1
*/

//Assignment  Operators
/*
     =	x = 5	x = 5	
    +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
    -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
    *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
    /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
    %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
*/

int z = 10;
z += 5;

//Comparison Operators 
/*
Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, 
because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.
The return value of a comparison is either True or False. These values are known as Boolean values,
and you will learn more about them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.
In the following example, we use the greater than operator (>) to find out if 5 is greater than 3:
 */

int x = 5;
int y = 3;
Console.WriteLine(x > y); // returns True because 5 is greater than 3

/*
    ==	Equal to	x == y	
    !=	Not equal	x != y	
    >	Greater than	x > y	
    <	Less than	x < y	
    >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
    <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
*/

//Logical Operators
/*
 && Logical and	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10	
 || Logical or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4	
 !	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
 */
