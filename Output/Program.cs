//To output values or print text in C#, you can use the WriteLine() method:
//Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

//You can add as many WriteLine() methods as you want.Note that it will add a new line for each method:

//Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
//Console.WriteLine("I am Learning C#");
//Console.WriteLine("It is awesome!");

//You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:
//Console.WriteLine(3 + 3);


/*There is also a Write() method, which is similar to WriteLine().
The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:*/

//Console.Write("Hello World! ");
//Console.Write("I will print on the same line.");
